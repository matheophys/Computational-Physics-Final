# Computational-Physics-Final
Running the code is fairly straightforward and is outlined in detail in the actual Jupyter notebook. As a user wanting to 
use the code, one would need to input initial four momenta, an array of angles, and a CM differential cross section in order
to use it. However, I have a trivial test of the code only needs to run the cells through to see the results.
